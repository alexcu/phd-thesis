7 dimensions are - community (collaboration), continuous integration (quality), documentation (maintainability), history (sustained evolution), issues (project management), license (accountability), unit testing (quality)
Community - core contributors 
CI - piecewise function to determine, if repository r uses a CI service
Github supports certain CI services and does not support CI services like Jenkins, Atlassian, Bamboo, Cloudship
Commit Frequency (History)
Comment Ratio (Documentation)
Test ratio - Ratio of test code lines for actual code lines
Implementation - Training the classifier (Evaluation Framework)
Organization repositories (Repositories with big organizations like Facebook, Google), Utility repositories.
Score based classifier - If score of a repository is greater than equal to reference score
Random Forest classifier - Tree based approach, multiple trees are found, each tree casts a vote and then aggregated to produce a result.
Validation Measures - False Positive Rate, False Negative Rate, Precision, Recall, F-Measure
100 projects that follow guidelines and 100 projects that do not follow guidelines},

annote = {AI is everywhere - medicine, science, transportation, privacy, security, fairness, economic, military
AI - robustness, risk sensitivity and safe exploration
AI Safety - supervised classification, reinforcement learning
Social impacts of AI and accidents in ML systems
Safety problems are where in the process things went wrong. 
Five broad categories of AI Safety research areas are avoiding side effects, avoiding reward hacking, scalable supervision, safe exploration and distributional shift. Having wrong objective function will cause negative side effects (Accomplishing some specific tasks), reward hacking(Designer admits some clever easy solution), scalable oversight(how to ensure safe behavior, even with limited access to the true objective function), safe exploration(negative/irrecoverable consequences that outweigh the long term value of exploration), robustness to distributional shift(how to avoid having ML systems make bad decisions)
A cleaning robot at office workspace is an illustrative example of AI Safety
Need for AI Safety - increasing promise of Reinforcement Learning (RL), trending more complex agents and environments and increasing autonomy in AI Systems
Avoiding negative side effects - many distruptive things, common sense constraints on the environment
Define an impact regularizer - formalize change to the environment, penalize state distance, choice of representation and distance metric
Learn a generalized impact regularizer
Penalize influence - not get into positions where there are side effects
Multi agent approaches - Inclusion of human agents in coperative inverse RL, reward autoencoder
Reward uncertainty - to avoid unanticipated side effects
Define a baseline policy around which changes are being considered
Avoiding reward hacking - Partially observed goals (Assumption on RL is that reward is directly experienced, but only partially observed), complicated systems, abstract rewards (hacking one dimensional space), Goodhart's Law(targeting highly correlated function to accomplish specific task), feedback loops(self-amplifying component), environmental embedding (human in the reward loop, giving the agent incentive)
Adversarial reward functions - exploit the problem with intension of high reward
Model lookahead - reward based on anticipated future states, not the current one
Adversarial blinding - blind a model to certain variables
Counterexample resistance - adversarial training
Trip wires - deliberate introduction of some plausible vulnerabilities 
Scalable oversight - semi-supervised RL, evaluation based on reward from all episodes, optimization based on limited reward samples
Safe exploration - destroy the agent or trap it in states it can't get out of it, cannot hard code all problems, reduce the need for domain specific engineering, optimise worst case performance, off policy estimation, inverse RL {\&} apprenticeship learning (Learning algorithm is provided with expert trajectories of near-optimal behavior)
Robustness to Distributional Change - recognize our own ignorance, trained on one distribution, deployed on different test distribution, limited by variance of the important estimate, covariate shift assumption (very strong and untestable), build a generative model for distribution(drawback - this is fragile), partially specified models with assumptions on some aspects of a distribution
Modeling distribution of errors of a model, assumption - errors are independent and gaussian distributed, a good example is speech systems},

List of well known peer reviewed SE journals is presented. Searched databases are Scopus, Science Direct, IEEE Explore, ACM DL.

Need for increased automation of data validation
Declarativity - Users to spend time on thinking, how their data should look like, Not to worry too much about how to implement the actual quality checks 
High flexibility on data validation
Data validation systems have to acknowledge - as data is being continuously produced
Scalability - Data validation systems should continuously scale to large datasets
Data quality dimensions - extension of the data (data values), intension of the data (the schema)
Completeness - The degree to which an entity includes data required to describe a real world object
Consistency - The degree to which a set of semantic rules are violated, Two types - Intra Relation Constraints (Tshirt size - S, M and L) and Inter Relation Constraints (Customer Id)
Accuracy - The correctness of data, Two types - syntactic and semantic 
Syntactic - Representation of a value with a corresponding definition domain
Semantic - Compares a value with its real world representation 
Unit tests for Data - Declarative definition of data quality constraints
Predictability
Data is seldomly static. Computing metrics for the growing dataset from all snapshots, result in incremental computations. For each feature column, summary statistics (minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, approximate quartiles) is computed.
Learning semantics of column and table names
Anomaly Detection - operates on historic time series of data, quality metrics (the ratio of missing values for different versions of a dataset)
Checks and constraints on dataframes
Metrics - size of the dataset, completeness of six columns, compliance for the three satisfies constraints
States Management
Logistic Regression -{\textgreater} SGD Classifier and hashing vectorizer
Experimental evaluation on 50 GB in parquet format, data sources are reddit.com and twitter

cases. Wrong model management decisions can lead to poor performance of a ML system and can result
in high maintenance cost. As both research on infrastructure as well as on algorithms is quickly evolving,
there is a lack of understanding of challenges and best practices for ML model management. Therefore,
this field is receiving increased attention in recent years, both from the data management as well as
from the ML community. In this paper, we discuss a selection of ML use cases, develop an overview
over conceptual, engineering, and data-processing related challenges arising in the management of the
corresponding ML models, and point out future research directions.},

ML Lifecycle is model development, training (training pipelines, trained models and live data), inference (prediction service and logic) and feedback to training, query and prediction from end user application
Model development stages are offline training data, data collection, cleaning and visualisation, feature engineering and model design and training and validation
Each stage (neural networks design, data managment, cluster management) demands different skills set.
Pervasive problems in ML are feature management, data provenance, pipeline reproducibility, low-latency serving, prediction monitoring
Facebook - FB Learner flow, Uber - Michelangelo, Google - TFX
Classical time series forecasting technique - ARIMA
Content moderation - offline training of models using manually labeled data
Automating model metadata tracking 
1. Managing the meta data - Who created the model at what time ? Which hyperparameters were used ? What feature transformations have been applied ?
2. Lineage - Which dataset was the model derived from ?
Which dataset was used for computing the evalution data ?
Model management challenges are conceptual challenges, data management challenges and engineering challenges
Conceptual challenges are ML model definition (To define the actual model to manage), model validation (To backtest the accuray of models, improvement might cause longer prediction times), decisions on model retraining, adversarial settings (understand the boundary conditions of the classifier)
Data management challenges are lack of declarative abstraction for the whole ML pipeline, querying model meta data
Engineering challenges are multi language code bases, heterogenous skill level of users, backward compatibility of trained models
Provenance - place of origin, prevasive - unwelcoming
ProvDB - a unified provenance, metadata management system, flexible and extensible ingestion mechanism, novel querying
Data Engineers, Data Scientists, Domain Experts
Evolution of Jupyter Notebook - targeting Data Scientists 
A holistic approach of conducting, auditing and continuously monitoring
ProvDB - developed under the umbrella of Datahub project, 'Schema later' approach
Caffe - a deep learning framework
Metadata - about accuracy and loss metrics for learned models
Cypher and Gremlin are query languages 
A version, identified by id is immutable in ProvDB
ProvDB two subsets - graph segmentation, graph summarization
Version -{\textgreater} artifact -{\textgreater} snapshot -{\textgreater} record
Artifacts - scripts, datasets, dervied results
Entities - Project artefacts (files, datasets, scripts)
Activities - System/user actions (train, git commit, cron jobs)
Agents - parties who are responsible for some activity (team member, system component)
Storing, querying and analyzing provenance graphs - versioned artifacts, evolving workflows, partial knowledge in collaboration
Raw Data -{\textgreater} Data Prep -{\textgreater} Training -{\textgreater} Deployment - cyclic steps of ML
ML Flow facilitates local execution and remote cluster deployment
ML Flow - Open source ML Platform, Works with any ML Library (Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch), Programming Language, deploy tool

MLflow tracking API supported in Azure Machine Learning
Leverage throughout all products, logging real time

                  {\textless}p class="a-plus-plus"{\textgreater}Supervised machine learning studies are gaining more significant recently because of the availability of the increasing number of the electronic documents from different resources. Text classification can be defined that the task was automatically categorized a group documents into one or more predefined classes according to their subjects. Thereby, the major objective of text classification is to enable users for extracting information from textual resource and deals with process such as retrieval, classification, and machine learning techniques together in order to classify different pattern. In text classification technique, term weighting methods design suitable weights to the specific terms to enhance the text classification performance. This paper surveys of text classification, process of different term weighing methods and comparison between different classification techniques.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

annote = {From Duplicate 1 (Assuring the Machine Learning Lifecycle: Desiderata, Methods, and Challenges - Ashmore, Rob; Calinescu, Radu; Paterson, Colin)
Desiderata - something that is needed/wanted
vision - ML is everywhere, it is determined by the level of assurance provided for ML
ML errors in smart cameras can be deleted, the selection of odd word in translation system can be ignored. But ML errors in medical diagnosis/self driving cars are unacceptable.
Understand the complex, iterative process of ML and use ML.
4 stages of ML Lifecycle - Data Management, Model Learning, Model Verification, Model Deployment
ML Learning - supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement
Convolutional NN is used in classification of road signs in self driving cars
ML represents the automated extraction of models/patterns from data.
Data Management - collection, augmentation, preprocessing and analysis of data
Augmentation - add further data samples
Model selection depends on problem type, volume {\&} structure of training data and personal experience.
Hyperparameter selection can cause overfitting, underfitting and model complexity.
Loss function is a measure of training errors.
Feature extraction can be subcategorised as numerical (blood sugar level in a healthcare system), ordinal (position in a queue in a traffic management system), categorical (an element(bus, car, truck) from the set in a self driving car)
MAPE control system - Monitor Analyze Plan Execute Control System
Learning - Deep learning, reinforcement learning, transfer learning, ensemble learning
Data Management - collection (source), preprocessing (one to one mapping), augmentation (one to many mapping)
Desiderata - relevant, complete, balanced, accurate
Relevant - the intersection between the dataset {\&} the desired behavior in intended operational domain
Complete - the way samples are distributed across input domain and subspaces of it.
Input domain space, operational domain space, failure domain space, adversarial domain space
Balanced - the distribution of features 
Accurate - how measurement issues can affect the way that samples reflect the intended operational domain
Challenges in relevancy - detection of hidden backdoors, demonstrating that synthetic data is appropriate, detecting {\&} correcting for data leakage
To consider whether a data set is complete, we can plot marginal distribution of each feature, ratio of sampling density between densely sampled {\&} sparsely sampled
Challenges in completeness - understanding completeness across operational domain, finding verifiable ways of achieving augmentation, demonstrating completeness across adversarial domain, labeling discrepancies introduced by human
Model categories are classification, regression, clustering and reinforcement.
Objective function reflects the requirements for the model.
Hyper parameter selection strategies - initialisation with values offered by ML frameworks, manual configuration based on recommendations from literature/experience, trial and error
NN model, used for facial recognition can be reused for operator fatigue.
Prediction errors have three components such as irreducible error, bias error and variance error.
Model specific parameters restrict the users the choice of model.},

METHODS: We conducted a 3-arm, cluster-randomized controlled trial at 4 worksites in Texas from 2010 through 2013 to compare a group-based, structured Booster Break program to an individual-based computer-prompt intervention and a usual-break control group; we analyzed physiologic, behavioral, and employee measures such as work social support, quality of life, and perceived stress. We also identified consistent and inconsistent attendees of the Booster Break sessions.
RESULTS: We obtained data from 175 participants (mean age, 43 y; 67{\%} racial/ethnic minority). Compared with the other groups, the consistent Booster Break attendees had greater weekly pedometer counts (P {\textless} .001), significant decreases in sedentary behavior and self-reported leisure-time physical activity (P {\textless} .001), and a significant increase in triglyceride concentrations (P = .02) (levels remained within the normal range). Usual-break participants significantly increased their body mass index, whereas Booster Break participants maintained body mass index status during the 6 months. Overall, Booster Break participants were 6.8 and 4.3 times more likely to have decreases in BMI and weekend sedentary time, respectively, than usual-break participants.
CONCLUSION: Findings varied among the 3 study groups; however, results indicate the potential for consistent attendees of the Booster Break intervention to achieve significant, positive changes related to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and body mass index.},

annote = {Training and serving data - production asset
Data Validation System (three components) - Data Analyzer, Data Validator (through schema), Model Unit Tester
Types of Data Validation - Single batch validation, inter batch validation, model testing
Single batch validation - Are there data errors within each new batch that is ingested by the pipeline ?
Any deviation from the expected characteristics, given expert domain knowledge - anomaly
Any disagreement during schema validation is flagged as an anomaly.
Data Validator - to avoid training on bad data
- Each anomaly corresponds to a validation of some property specified in the schema
Inter batch validation - There are certain anomalies that only manifest when two or more batches of data are considered together
Training-serving skew - skew between training and serving data , reasons - different code paths to generate training(offline) and serving(online) data
Three categories of skew - Feature skew (changes to training code not reflected on serving code), Distribution skew (during sampling), scoring/serving skew(only subset of scored examples are actually served)
Time saving - by catching important data anomalies early, by helping teams to diagnose model-quality problems caused by data errors
Anomalies are categorised
Changing data type of a feature (from string to int) is a serious anomaly
Feature presence - some features are expected to be present in all examples, others present only in a fraction
Feature domains - Many features assume values only from a limited domain
Feature value count - Features can be single valued/list},

annote = {Defining boundaries for input space varies at different stages of software development and these boundaries are rich sources of software errors.
Finding boundaries will help to identify test cases which are near to the borderline of valid and invalid regions. This facilitates robustness and continual operation of the software, irrespective of correctness.
The research was conducted in two stages, namely generating automated data and mutating the valid test cases using property switching search.
GodelTest framework is utilized to develop an automated test data generator and it is assumed that the generator is fault free. The fitness function is calculated between the current candidate and the highest candidate of among already identified candidates and the fitness function needs to be maximized. 
In the second step, closed paired sets of test cases on either side of the boundary are selected and are swapped. Each candidate is started with the desired property, which is validity, and is mutated until the desired property is changed.},

note = {{Forth industrial revolution - fast {\&}} widespread AI
Shift towards more algorithmic society
AI - Lack of transparency, powerful predictions, cannot be directly explained, improve trust and transparency
Monetary value of AI - Increase in global investment on AI (12 billion USD in 2017 to 52.2 trillion USD in 2021)
AI Market growth (480 billion USD in 2017 to 2.59 trillion USD in 2021)
Reasons for XAI - Explain to justify, explain to control, explain to improve, explain to discover
XAI Application domains - transportation, healthcare, legal, finance, military
The technical challenge question in enabling XAI - Why the use of XAI is not systematic ?
Why is not everyone using XAI?
Four basic research areas - Data science, AI/ML, Human science, Human Computer Interface (HCI)
Six major academic databases - SCOPUS, IEEExplore, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, Citeseer Library, ScienceDirect
More complex the model, it is more dificult to interpret.
Scoop related methods - understanding the entire model behavior/understanding a single prediction, broadly categorised into global interpretability and local interpretability methods
Model related methods - visualisation (surrogate models, Partial Dependence Plot (PDP), Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE)), knowledge extraction, influence methods, example based explanation
Surrogate models - a simple model used to explain complex models
Knowledge extraction - rule extraction (pedogogical, decompositional, ecelectic), model distillation
Influence methods - sensitivity analysis, layer wise relevance propagation, feature importance},
