In \cref{ch:introduction}, we defined attributes of a common set of \glsac{ai}-based cloud services that we label \glsplx{iws}. Specifically, we scope the primary body of this study's work on a mature subset of \glspl{iws} providing computer vision---\glsplx{cvs}---such as Google Cloud Vision \citepweb{GoogleCloud:Home}, AWS Rekognition \citepweb{AWS:Home}, Azure Computer Vision \citepweb{Azure:Home}, and Watson Visual Recognition \citepweb{IBM:Home}. We claim developers have not yet internalised the nuances of working with components that have a probabilistic behaviour ($2+2$ \textit{always} equals 4) whereas an \gls{iws}'s `intelligence' component (a black box) returns probabilistic results ($2+2$ \textit{might} equal 4 \textit{with a confidence of} 95\%). Thus, there is a mindset mismatch between probabilistic results (from the \gls{api} provider) and results interpreted with certainty (from the \gls{api} consumer).
What effect does this anchor mismatch have on the developer's approach towards building probabilistic software? What can we learn from common software engineering practices (e.g., \citep{Pressman:2005vf,Sommerville:2011uc}) that apply to resolve this mismatch and thereby improve quality, such as \gls{vv}? Chiefly, we consider this question around three lenses of software engineering: creating an \gls{iws}, using an \gls{iws}, and the nature of \glspl{iws} themselves.

Our chief concern lies with interaction and integration between \gls{iws} providers and consumers, the nature of applications built using an \gls{iws}, and the impact this has on software quality. We triangulate this around three pillars, which we diagrammatically represent in \cref{fig:background:preface:iws-mindset-clash-pillars}.
 
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{(\arabic*})]
\item \textbf{The development of the \gls{iws}.} We investigate the internal quality attributes of creating an \gls{iws} from the \gls{iws} \textit{provider's} perspective. That is, we ask if existing verification techniques are sufficient enough to ensure that the \gls{iws} being developed actually satisfies the \gls{iws} consumer's needs and if the internal perspective of creating the system with a procedural mindset clashes with the outside perspective (i.e., pillar 2).
\item \textbf{The usage of the \gls{iws}.} We investigate the external quality attributes of using an \gls{iws} from the \gls{iws} \textit{consumer's} perspective. That is, we ask if existing validation techniques are sufficient enough to ensure that the end-users can actually use an \gls{iws} to build their software in the ways they expect the \gls{iws} to work.
\item \textbf{The nature of an \gls{iws}.} We investigate what standard software engineering practices apply when developing probabilistic systems. That is, we tackle what best practices exist when developing systems that are inherently stochastic and probabilistic, i.e., the `black box' intelligence itself.
\end{enumerate}

Does a clash of procedural consumer mindsets who use a \gls{iws} and the probabilistic provider mindsets who develop them exist? And what impact does this have on the inside and outside perspective? Throughout this chapter, we will review these three core pillars due to such  mindset mismatch from the anchoring perspective of software quality, particularly around \glsx{vv} and related quality attributes, probabilistic and non-deterministic software, and the nature of \glspl{api}.

\section{Chapter Summary}

This background chapter explored nuances of interacting and integrating with probabilistic components, namely \glspl{iws}, and the impacts this may have to software quality. Firstly, we explored both internal and external quality attributes of \glspl{iws} and how leakage of internal quality may affect the external quality of client applications. We discussed how \gls{vv} approaches can assist in improving quality assurance of probabilistic components, and reviewed how various software quality attributes and models emphasise reliability of systems and their associated documentation (namely, through the sub-characteristics of robustness, consistency and completeness). We applied this context to \glspl{cvs}, giving examples where these cloud services may not be reliable. Lastly, we applied the narrative of reliability to the overarching nature of computer vision itself, exploring how the underlying \gls{ml} models behind a \gls{cvs} can potentially fail, and discussed how any such \gls{ml} model should be explainable to ensure its reliability and trustworthiness. Lastly, we discussed the impact an \gls{api} can have when it is of poor quality, again impacting the internal quality of a system. In the next chapter, we propose several research strategies in the search for further insight into the developer's approach toward existing \gls{iws} \glspl{api}.
