FR using deep networks used classification layer [15,17] which is inefficient. [15] reduced dimentionality using PCA.

Builds on two architectures of Zeiler {\&} Fergus [22] (inspired by improvements made in [9] by adding 1x1xd convolutional layers between standard convolutional layers of [22]) and Inception Model [16].

Compared [22]'s with [16]'s. [16]'s are much smaller in size (in depth and number of filters) and can run on a phone. (20x fewer parameters and 5x fewer FLOPS).}

FR using deep networks used classification layer [15,17] which is inefficient. [15] reduced dimentionality using PCA.

Builds on two architectures of Zeiler {\&} Fergus [22] (inspired by improvements made in [9] by adding 1x1xd convolutional layers between standard convolutional layers of [22]) and Inception Model [16].

Compared [22]'s with [16]'s. [16]'s are much smaller in size (in depth and number of filters) and can run on a phone. (20x fewer parameters and 5x fewer FLOPS).}

FR using deep networks used classification layer [15,17] which is inefficient. [15] reduced dimentionality using PCA.

Builds on two architectures of Zeiler {\&} Fergus [22] (inspired by improvements made in [9] by adding 1x1xd convolutional layers between standard convolutional layers of [22]) and Inception Model [16].

Compared [22]'s with [16]'s. [16]'s are much smaller in size (in depth and number of filters) and can run on a phone. (20x fewer parameters and 5x fewer FLOPS).}
