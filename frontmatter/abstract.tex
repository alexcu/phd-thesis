\glsunset{ai}

% General statement introducing the broad research area
Application developers are eager to integrate \gls{ml} into their software, with a plethora of vendors providing pre-packaged components---typically under the `\gls{ai}' banner---to entice them.
% An explanation of the specific problem (difficulty, obstacle, challenge)
Such components are marketed as developer `friendly' \gls{ml} and easy for them to integrate (being `just another' component added to their toolchain). These components are, however, non-trivial: in particular, developers unknowingly add the risk of mixing nondeterministic \gls{ml} behaviour into their applications that, in turn, impact the quality of their software.
% Review of existing or standard solutions to this problem
Prior research advocates that a developer's conceptual understanding is critical to effective interpretation of reusable components. However, these ready-made \gls{ai} components do not present sufficient detail to allow developers to acquire this conceptual understanding.
% Outline of the proposed new solution
In this study, by use of a mixed-methods approach of survey and action research, we investigate if the application developers' deterministic approach to software development clashes with the mindset needed to incorporate probabilistic components. Our goal is to develop a framework to better document such \gls{ai} components that improves both the quality of the software produced and the developer productivity behind it.
