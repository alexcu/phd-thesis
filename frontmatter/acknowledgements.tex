A long journey of 20 years education has led me to this thesis and upon reflection, there are so many people that have helped get me to this point. To start, I must thank my family for your support. Each of you have always been there for me in times good and bad. I'm especially grateful to my mother, Rosa, and father, Paul, for your love and support, and to my nieces Nina and Lucy---though too young to read this now---for bringing us all so much joy in the last three years. I thank all my teachers, particularly Natalie Heath, whose hard efforts paid off in my tertiary education, and, of course, my four amazing (super-)supervisors. Professor Rajesh Vasa, thank you for your many revisions, patience and in your efforts to shape this work: your years of phenomenal guidance---both as a supervisor and as a mentor---has helped rewire my thinking and worldview to far wider perspectives and approach thought and problem-solving in a remarkably new light. I thank Professor John Grundy for your efforts and for being such an approachable and hard-working supervisor, always willing to provide feedback and guidance, and help me get over the finish line. I also thank Associate Professor Mohamed Abdelrazek for your help in shaping many of the works within this thesis, and lastly, Associate Professor Andrew Cain, who not only taught me the realm of programming back in undergrad days, but who gave me the support that a PhD was within my reach, of which I had never fathomed. I must thank everyone at the Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute for creating such an enjoyable environment to work in, especially Jake Renzella, Rodney Pilgrim, Mahdi Babaei, and Reuben Wilson for their friendship over these years and for all the coffee runs, conversations, and ideas shared. And, lastly, to Tom Fellowes: thank you for being by my side throughout this journey.
