A long journey of 20 years education has led me to this thesis, and there are so many people who've helped me get to this point that deserve thanking. To start, I must thank my family; you have always been there for me in times good and bad. I'm especially grateful to my mother, Rosa, my father, Paul, my siblings, Marc and Lisa, and my nonna, Michelina Bonacci, for your love and support. I also thank my nieces Nina and Lucy (though too young to read this now!) for bringing us all so much joy in these last three years. I thank all my teachers, particularly Natalie Heath, whose hard efforts paid off in my tertiary education, and, of course, all those who assisted me along and help shape this PhD. Firstly, to Professor Rajesh Vasa, thank you for your many revisions, patience, ideas and efforts to shape this work: your years of phenomenal guidance---both as a supervisor and as a mentor---has reshaped my worldview to far wider perspectives and I now approach thought and problem-solving in a remarkably new light. Secondly, I thank Professor John Grundy for your efforts and for being such an approachable and hard-working supervisor, always willing to provide feedback and guidance, and help me get over the finish line. I also thank Dr Scott Barnett for the many fruitful discussions shared, for the interest you have shown in my work, and the joint collaborations we achieved in the last two years; Associate Professor Mohamed Abdelrazek for your many contributions within this thesis; and, lastly, Associate Professor Andrew Cain, who not only taught me the realm of programming back in undergraduate days, but who first suggested a PhD was within my reach, of which I had never fathomed. I must thank everyone at the Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute for creating such an enjoyable environment to work in, especially Jake Renzella,  Reuben Wilson, Mahdi Babaei, Rodney Pilgrim, and Simon Vajda and for their friendship over these years and for all the coffee runs, conversations, and ideas shared. And, lastly, to Tom Fellowes: thank you for being by my side throughout this journey.
