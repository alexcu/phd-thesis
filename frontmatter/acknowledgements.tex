\vspace{-6\bigskipamount}

A long journey of 21 years education has led me to this thesis, and there are so many people who've helped me get to this point that deserve thanking. 
To start, I must thank my loving family: my mother, Rosa, my father, Paul, my siblings, Marc and Lisa, and my nonna, Michelina Bonacci. You have all been there for me in times both good and bad. I will always be grateful. And, lastly, to my nieces Nina and Lucy (though too young to read this now!), I thank you both bringing us all so much joy in these few years.
Secondly, I thank all my teachers whose hard efforts paid off in my education, particularly Natalie Heath from my time at Parade College. Without you all, I would not be where I am today.
And thirdly, of course, I thank all those who have helped shape this thesis. Thank you Professor Rajesh Vasa for the many revisions, patience, ideas, and efforts in shaping this work. Your years of guidance, both as a supervisor and as a mentor, has reshaped my worldview to a remarkably new light, of which I will be forever grateful for. 
To Professor John Grundy, thank you for being such an approachable and hard-working supervisor who is always willing to provide structure and feedback. I will always appreciate your guidance and mentorship to help me get me over the finish line, and the assistance you have shown me in these last few years.
To Associate Professor Andrew Cain, thank you for who not only teaching me the wonderful realm of programming back in undergrad, but for first suggesting a PhD was within my reach; a concept I'd never even fathomed!
I also must thank Dr Scott Barnett for the interest you have shown in my work and for the joint collaborations we achieved in the last two years, in addition to Associate Professor Mohamed Abdelrazek your many contributions. 
I also extend a big thank you to Jake Renzella for your many years of shared friendship and support, spanning as far back as our teaching days in second-year to today, as we wrap up our PhD theses. You've been such a wonderful friend and I cannot thank you enough. (Who would've thought this is where we'd end up!)
To everyone at the Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute: thank you for creating such an enjoyable environment to work in, especially to Reuben Wilson, Dean Biddau, Beth Bland, Mahdi Babaei, Rodney Pilgrim, and Simon Vajda and for your friendship over these years and for all the coffee runs, conversations, and ideas shared.
And, lastly, to Tom Fellowes: thank you for being by my side throughout this journey as we have worked to complete our PhDs together.
